    "Analyze global vaccination data to understand trends in vaccination coverage, disease incidence, and effectiveness. Data will be cleaned and stored in a SQL database. Power BI will be used to connect to the SQL database and create interactive dashboards that provide insights on vaccination strategies and their impact on disease control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Use Cases\n",
    "1.  **Public Health Strategy:**\n",
    "    *   Assess the effectiveness of vaccination programs in different regions and populations.\n",
    "    *   Prioritize areas with low vaccination coverage for targeted interventions.\n",
    "2.  **Disease Prevention:**\n",
    "    *   Identify diseases with high incidence rates despite vaccination efforts, suggesting vaccine inefficacies or areas for improvement.\n",
    "    *   Support policies on booster vaccines or new vaccine introductions.\n",
    "3.  **Resource Allocation:**\n",
    "    *   Determine regions with low vaccination coverage and plan targeted resource distribution to improve vaccination rates.\n",
    "    *   Forecast vaccine demand based on current trends for better supply chain management.\n",
    "4.  **Global Health Policy:**\n",
    "    *   Provide data-driven recommendations for vaccination policy formulation.\n",
    "    *   Support governments and health organizations with evidence on vaccine effectiveness."

    "The analysis and visualizations should answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy Level:**\n",
    "*   How do vaccination rates correlate with a decrease in disease incidence?\n",
    "*   What is the drop-off rate between 1st dose and subsequent doses?.\n",
    "*   Are vaccination rates different between genders? (*Note: Data not available in the provided dataset*)\n",
    "*   How does education level impact vaccination rates? (*Note: Data not available*)\n",
    "*   What is the urban vs. rural vaccination rate difference? (*Note: Data not available*)\n",
    "*   Has the rate of booster dose uptake increased over time?\n",
    "*   Is there a seasonal pattern in vaccination uptake? (*Note: Data aggregated by year, seasonality analysis not possible*)\n",
    "*   How does population density relate to vaccination coverage? (*Note: Data not available*)\n",
    "*   Which regions have high disease incidence despite high vaccination rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium Level (combination of different tables):**\n",
    "*   Is there a correlation between vaccine introduction and a decrease in disease cases?\n",
    "*   What is the trend in disease cases before and after vaccination campaigns?\n",
    "*   Which diseases have shown the most significant reduction in cases due to vaccination?\n",
    "*   What percentage of the target population has been covered by each vaccine?\n",
    "*   How does the vaccination schedule (e.g., booster doses) impact target population coverage?\n",
    "*   Are there significant disparities in vaccine introduction timelines across WHO regions?\n",
    "*   How does vaccine coverage correlate with disease reduction for specific antigens?\n",
    "*   Are there specific regions or countries with low coverage despite high availability of vaccines?\n",
    "*   What are the gaps in coverage for vaccines targeting high-priority diseases (e.g., TB, Hepatitis B)?\n",
    "*   Are certain diseases more prevalent in specific geographic areas?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario Based:**\n",
    "*   A government health agency wants to identify regions with low vaccination coverage to allocate resources effectively.\n",
    "*   A public health organization wants to evaluate the effectiveness of a measles vaccination campaign launched five years ago.\n",
    "*   A vaccine manufacturer wants to estimate vaccine demand for a specific disease in the upcoming year.\n",
    "*   A sudden outbreak of influenza occurs in a specific region, and authorities need to ramp up vaccination efforts.\n",
    "*   Researchers want to explore the incidence rates of polio in populations with no vaccination coverage.\n",
    "*   WHO wants to track global progress toward achieving a target of 95% vaccination coverage for measles by 2030.\n",
    "*   A health agency wants to allocate vaccines to high-risk populations such as children under five and the elderly.\n",
    "*   A non-profit wants to detect disparities in vaccination coverage across different socioeconomic groups within a country.\n",
    "*   Authorities want to determine how vaccination rates vary throughout the year.\n",
    "*   Two regions use different vaccination strategies (e.g., door-to-door vs. centralized vaccination clinics). Authorities want to know which strategy is more effective."

    "    -   Open Power BI Desktop.\n",
    "    -   Go to **Get Data > Database > MySQL database**.\n",

    "    -   Under the **Database** tab, enter your `root` username and password.\n",
    "3.  **Load Tables:** In the Navigator window, select all five tables (`coverage`, `incidence_rate`, etc.) and click **Load**.\n",
    "4.  **Create Relationships (Model View):**\n",
    "    -   Go to the **Model view** in Power BI.\n",
    "    -   Create relationships by dragging and dropping between key columns. The goal is to link all tables together.\n",
    "        -   `coverage.country_code` <-> `incidence_rate.country_code`\n",
    "        -   `coverage.record_year` <-> `incidence_rate.record_year`\n",
    "        -   Connect `reported_cases`, `vaccine_introduction`, and `vaccine_schedule` to the other tables in a similar way using `country_code` and `record_year`.\n",
    "    -   This creates a star schema where you can analyze data across all tables simultaneously."
